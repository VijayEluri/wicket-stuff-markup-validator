{"name":"Validator.Wicket","body":"This project validates the output of your [Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org)\r\napplication while running. It includes a error view showing each validation error,\r\nwith line-precise error messages.\r\n\r\nValidates the following w3c standards:\r\n\r\n * HTML 4.01 Strict\r\n * HTML 4.01 Transitional\r\n * XHTML 1.0 Strict\r\n * XHTML 1.0 Transitional\r\n * HTML 5\r\n\r\nThis project includes the HTML validator taken from [html\r\nvalidator](http://validator.nu).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMake sure you use Wicket 1.5. This validator does not run on Wicket 1.4 or \r\nearlier. Java 6 is also a minimum requirement.\r\n\r\nThere is no release available at this time. You have to build a version locally yourself (using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org).\r\n\r\nAdd the Wicket Stuff validator to your POM as a dependency:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>org.wicketstuff.htmlvalidator</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>htmlvalidator</artifactId>\r\n        <version>1.5-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n\r\nDepending on your setup you need to use a different `scope` (for example test\r\nor provided to prevent the validator to be deployed to production).\r\n\r\nAdd the following lines to your `Application`'s init method:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void init() {\r\n        super.init();\r\n        getMarkupSettings().setStripWicketTags(true);\r\n        getRequestCycleSettings().addResponseFilter(new HtmlValidationResponseFilter());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou might want to put a check for the configuration of your application \r\naround the addition of the response filter, to ensure that the filter doesn't run\r\nin production mode:\r\n\r\n    if (RuntimeConfigurationType.DEVELOPMENT == getConfigurationType()) {\r\n        getRequestCycleSettings().addResponseFilter(new HtmlValidationResponseFilter());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\nBuilding Wicket.Validator is not difficult: you need to have Java 6 and Maven 3 installed, \r\nand know how to checkout sources from github. Assuming you know how to use Git, you need \r\nto do the following on a command prompt:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git://github.com/dashorst/wicket-stuff-markup-validator.git\r\n    $ cd wicket-stuff-markup-validator\r\n    $ mvn install\r\n\r\nThen you can add the Wicket.Validator dependency to your own application using Maven.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIn order to make this work, we had to provide jar files of several open source\r\nprojects required by the HTML validator code:\r\n\r\n* [isorelax](http://sourceforge.net/projects/iso-relax) (taken from\r\n  http://sourceforge.net/projects/iso-relax, release 20041111, MIT License)\r\n\r\n* [jing](http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang) (taken from\r\n  http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang, release 20091111, BSD License)\r\n\r\nSince these recent releases are not available from the central Maven\r\nrepository, we included the sources and provide the jar files in our own\r\nnamespace (the package names are unmodified).\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Validate your Wicket markup without pain","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
